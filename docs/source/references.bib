               bodies, membranes and nuclei from microscopy images. Deep
               learning has enabled great progress on this problem, but current
               methods are specialized for images that have large training
               datasets. Here we introduce a generalist, deep learning-based
               segmentation method called Cellpose, which can precisely segment
               cells from a wide range of image types and does not require model
               retraining or parameter adjustments. Cellpose was trained on a
               new dataset of highly varied images of cells, containing over
               70,000 segmented objects. We also demonstrate a three-dimensional
               (3D) extension of Cellpose that reuses the two-dimensional (2D)
               model and does not require 3D-labeled data. To support community
               contributions to the training data, we developed software for
               manual labeling and for curation of the automated results.
               Periodically retraining the model on the community-contributed
               data will ensure that Cellpose improves constantly.",

               has increased exponentially over recent years. Glass slides from
               retrospective cohorts, some with patient follow-up data are
               digitised for the development and validation of artificial
               intelligence (AI) tools. Such resources, therefore, become very
               important, with the need to ensure that their quality is of the
               standard necessary for downstream AI development. However, manual
               quality control of large cohorts of WSIs by visual assessment is
               unfeasible, and whilst quality control AI algorithms exist, these
               focus on bespoke aspects of image quality, e.g. focus, or use
               traditional machine-learning methods, which are unable to
               classify the range of potential image artefacts that should be
               considered. In this study, we have trained and validated a
               multi-task deep neural network to automate the process of quality
               control of a large retrospective cohort of prostate cases from
               which glass slides have been scanned several years after
               production, to determine both the usability of the images at the
               diagnostic level (considered in this study to be the minimal
               standard for research) and the common image artefacts present.
               Using a two-layer approach, quality overlays of WSIs were
               generated from a quality assessment (QA) undertaken at
               patch-level at [Formula: see text] magnification. From these
               quality overlays the slide-level quality scores were predicted
               and then compared to those generated by three specialist
               urological pathologists, with a Pearson correlation of 0.89 for
               overall 'usability' (at a diagnostic level), and 0.87 and 0.82
               for focus and H\&E staining quality scores respectively. To
               demonstrate its wider potential utility, we subsequently applied
               our QA pipeline to the TCGA prostate cancer cohort and to a
               colorectal cancer cohort, for comparison. Our model, designated
               as PathProfiler, indicates comparable predicted usability of
               images from the cohorts assessed (86-90\% of WSIs predicted to be
               usable), and perhaps more significantly is able to predict WSIs
               that could benefit from an intervention such as re-scanning or
               re-staining for quality improvement. We have shown in this study
               that AI can be used to automate the process of quality control of
               large retrospective WSI cohorts to maximise their utility for
               research.",

                   Focus Quality Assessment (FQA) methods are highly desirable
                   to help significantly accelerate the clinical workflows.
                   Existing FQA methods include both knowledge-driven and
                   data-driven approaches. While data-driven approaches such as
                   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based methods have shown
                   great promises, they are difficult to use in practice due to
                   their high computational complexity and lack of
                   transferability. Here, we propose a highly efficient
                   CNN-based model that maintains fast computations similar to
                   the knowledge-driven methods without excessive hardware

               devised the Clinical Histopathology Imaging Evaluation Foundation

               learning framework to extract pathology imaging features for

               unsupervised pretraining for tile-level feature identification
               and weakly supervised pretraining for whole-slide pattern

               success of deep learning in medical image analysis. However,
               assembling such large annotations is very challenging, especially
               for histopathological images with unique characteristics (e.g.,
               gigapixel image size, multiple cancer types, and wide staining
               variations). To alleviate this issue, self-supervised learning
               (SSL) could be a promising solution that relies only on unlabeled
               data to generate informative representations and generalizes well
               to various downstream tasks even with limited annotations. In
               this work, we propose a novel SSL strategy called
               semantically-relevant contrastive learning (SRCL), which compares
               relevance between instances to mine more positive pairs. Compared
               to the two views from an instance in traditional contrastive
               learning, our SRCL aligns multiple positive instances with
               similar visual concepts, which increases the diversity of
               positives and then results in more informative representations.
               We employ a hybrid model (CTransPath) as the backbone, which is
               designed by integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) and
               a multi-scale Swin Transformer architecture. The CTransPath is
               pretrained on massively unlabeled histopathological images that
               could serve as a collaborative local-global feature extractor to
               learn universal feature representations more suitable for tasks
               in the histopathology image domain. The effectiveness of our
               SRCL-pretrained CTransPath is investigated on five types of

               weakly-supervised whole-slide image classification, mitosis
               detection, and colorectal adenocarcinoma gland segmentation),
               covering nine public datasets. The results show that our
               SRCL-based visual representations not only achieve
               state-of-the-art performance in each dataset, but are also more
               robust and transferable than other SSL methods and ImageNet

                   that increasing the training data set and model size and
                   integrating domain-specific image processing techniques can
                   significantly enhance the model's performance on downstream
                   tasks. Building on these insights, our work incorporates
                   several recent modifications to the standard DINOv2 framework
                   from the literature to optimize the training of pathology
                   FMs. We also apply a post-training procedure for fine-tuning
                   models on higher-resolution images to further enrich the
                   information encoded in the embeddings. We present three novel
                   pathology FMs trained on up to two orders of magnitude fewer
                   WSIs than those used to train other state-of-the-art FMs
                   while demonstrating a comparable or superior performance on
                   downstream tasks. Even the model trained on TCGA alone (12k
                   WSIs) outperforms most existing FMs and, on average, matches
                   Virchow2, the second-best FM published to date. This suggests
                   that there still remains a significant potential for further
                   improving the models and algorithms used to train pathology
                   FMs to take full advantage of the vast data collections.",

              in disease classification, tumor microenvironment description and
              identification of new biomarkers. However, the potential of
              computational pathology in personalized medicine comes with
              significant challenges, particularly in annotating whole slide
              images (WSI), which is time-consuming, costly and subject to
              inter-observer variability. To address these challenges,
              Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution
              to learn representations from histology patches and leverage large
              volumes of unlabelled WSI. Recently, Masked Image Modeling (MIM)
              as a SSL framework has emerged and is now considered to outperform
              purely contrastive learning paradigms. In this work, we therefore
              explore the application of MIM to histology using iBOT, a
              self-supervised transformer-based framework. Through a wide range
              of 17 downstream tasks over seven cancer indications, both at the
              slide and patch levels, we provide recommendations on the
              pre-training of large models for histology data using MIM. First,
              we demonstrate that in-domain pre-training with iBOT outperforms
              both ImageNet pre-training and a model pre-trained with a purely
              contrastive learning objective, MoCo v2. Second, we show that
              Vision Transformers (ViT) models, when scaled appropriately, have
              the capability to learn pan-cancer representations that benefit a
              large variety of downstream tasks. Finally, our iBOT ViT-Base
              model (80 million parameters), pre-trained on more than 40 million
              histology images from 16 different cancer types, achieves
              state-of-the-art performance in most weakly-supervised WSI
              classification tasks compared to other SSL frameworks available in
              the literature. This paves the way for the development of a

               various pathology tasks across a diverse array of diseases and
               patient cohorts. However, model training is often difficult due
               to label scarcity in the medical domain, and a model's usage is
               limited by the specific task and disease for which it is trained.
               Additionally, most models in histopathology leverage only image
               data, a stark contrast to how humans teach each other and reason
               about histopathologic entities. We introduce CONtrastive learning
               from Captions for Histopathology (CONCH), a visual-language
               foundation model developed using diverse sources of
               histopathology images, biomedical text and, notably, over 1.17
               million image-caption pairs through task-agnostic pretraining.
               Evaluated on a suite of 14 diverse benchmarks, CONCH can be
               transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks involving
               histopathology images and/or text, achieving state-of-the-art

                   a mismatch between most clinical analysis, which is defined
                   at the level of one or more whole slide images, and
                   foundation models to date, which process the thousands of

                   across a large number of tiles in multiple whole slide images

                   gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is becoming increasingly
                   valuable in computational pathology. These models hold the
                   potential to advance critical tasks such as few-shot
                   classification, slide retrieval, and patient stratification.
                   Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend
                   the principles of SSL from small images (e.g., 224 x 224
                   patches) to entire slides, usually by aligning two different
                   augmentations (or views) of the slide. Yet the resulting
                   representation remains constrained by the limited clinical
                   and biological diversity of the views. Instead, we postulate
                   that slides stained with multiple markers, such as
                   immunohistochemistry, can be used as different views to form
                   a rich task-agnostic training signal. To this end, we
                   introduce Madeleine, a multimodal pretraining strategy for
                   slide representation learning. Madeleine is trained with a
                   dual global-local cross-stain alignment objective on large
                   cohorts of breast cancer samples (N=4,211 WSIs across five
                   stains) and kidney transplant samples (N=12,070 WSIs across
                   four stains). We demonstrate the quality of slide
                   representations learned by Madeleine on various downstream
                   evaluations, ranging from morphological and molecular
                   classification to prognostic prediction, comprising 21 tasks
                   using 7,299 WSIs from multiple medical centers. Code is

               microenvironment, but its widespread use is limited by cost, time
               and tissue availability. Here we present HistoPlexer, a deep
               learning framework that generates spatially resolved protein
               multiplexes directly from standard haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E)
               histopathology images. HistoPlexer jointly predicts multiple
               tumour and immune markers using a conditional generative
               adversarial architecture with custom loss functions designed to
               ensure pixel- and embedding-level similarity while mitigating
               slice-to-slice variations. A comprehensive evaluation of
               metastatic melanoma samples demonstrates that
               HistoPlexer-generated protein maps closely resemble real maps, as
               validated by expert assessment. They preserve crucial biological
               relationships by capturing spatial co-localization patterns among
               proteins. The spatial distribution of immune infiltration from
               HistoPlexer-generated protein multiplex enables stratification of
               tumours into immune subtypes. In an independent cohort,
               integration of HistoPlexer-derived features into predictive
               models enhances performance in survival prediction and immune
               subtype classification compared to models using H\&E features
               alone. To assess broader applicability, we benchmarked
               HistoPlexer on publicly available pixel-aligned datasets from
               different cancer types. In all settings, HistoPlexer consistently
               outperformed baseline methods, demonstrating robustness across
               diverse tissue types and imaging conditions. By enabling
               whole-slide protein multiplex generation from routine H\&E
               images, HistoPlexer offers a cost- and time-efficient approach to
               tumour microenvironment characterization with strong potential to
               advance precision oncology.",

               However, the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets in

               In this study, we developed the Multimodal transformer with
